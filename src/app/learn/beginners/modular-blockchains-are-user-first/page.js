              Blockchains are a social movement as much as they are a
              technology. They help communities of people independently organize
              and carry out their goals. Of course, this means that blockchains
              themselves need to stand for certain values. Without values,
              blockchains would be no better than web2 tech companies. Here are
              the values that modular blockchains aim for.

              The point of open blockchains is that they are verifiable. Anybody
              should be able to run a node and personally verify that the
              network is operating correctly. While validators are responsible
              for processing transactions, the users who run nodes make sure
              that validators are behaving correctly. If a validator decides to
              act negatively, users can verify the behavior and punish it
              accordingly - through on-chain penalties like slashing or socially
              through forking.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              Since blockchains depend on users running nodes to keep the
              network secure, modular blockchains aim to minimize the cost of
              running a node. If running a node is too expensive, not many users
              will be able to afford it. This reduces the security of the chain,
              which could make it easier to attack.

              With new innovations like fraud or validity proofs and data
              availability sampling, users can run a low-cost node that has the
              same security as a more expensive full node. By keeping the cost
              low for users to run nodes, they can personally verify and
              participate as first-class citizens of the network.

              Most effort spent building blockchains has gone towards new L1s.
              The problem is that each new L1 creates its own walled-off
              ecosystem that competes with every other L1. This leads to
              maximalism as they all fight to bring in new users to their
              ecosystem.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              Modular blockchains create a collaborative environment with many
              connected chains. Each new user that a modular blockchain brings
              in creates value for the whole modular ecosystem, not just a
              single L1. Modular blockchains collaborate while monolithic L1s
              compete.

              The other benefit of collaboration is that developers can reuse
              and build on existing modular blockchains. This allows them to mix
              and match the components they need instead of building an entirely
              new L1 whose tech is limited to a single chain.

            <Body>
              Blockchains enable sovereignty by allowing groups of people to
              organize in a shared setting without requiring a trusted
              intermediary. Modular blockchains, in particular, give communities
              the option of sovereignty. With sovereign rollups, communities can
              own a chain that is independent.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              If part of the community has different goals from the rest of the
              group and wants to pursue their own vision, they can fork the
              sovereign rollup and organize it around their community and
              mission. Sovereignty provides complete flexibility and freedom to
              the community.
            </Body>
            <Body>
              If the community does not require sovereignty, they can
              alternatively choose to use a chain that is shared by many other
              distinct communities. The flexibility of choice over sovereignty
              is completely up to the communities choice, aided by modular
              blockchains.
